# 👋 About Me

I'm an independent software and web developer, founder of I-Mergie. With a strong background in backend and frontend development, I work across various technologies including Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP and C++. 

## 🌱 What I Believe In
I’m driven by the idea that technology should serve people first. Through my work, I aim to create practical, ethical, and privacy-conscious solutions that simplify tasks, protect data, and make digital tools more accessible—especially for those who aren’t tech professionals.
I will focus mainly on subject of automation.

## 🤝 My Goal on GitHub

- Share only clean, well-structured, and secure code (which is why I don't have any public repositories worth sharing — yet).
- Collaborate with developers who want to build solutions that truly help users in their daily lives.
- Contribute to meaningful, people-first projects with long-term value. (If I find the time to do so).
